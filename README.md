# obliquie-strategies-bot

Yo dawg, we heard you like procedurally generated oblique strategies, so we put some procedural generation in your oblique strategies 

Forked from <https://github.com/gordonbrander/prompt_generator>.

See <https://subconscious.substack.com/p/prompt-generator>.

## How to use it

Close your eyes.

Would a shower help clear things up?

Partition your thoughts into two bins.

Prepare your anus.

Run the script.

Now, receive the prompt and ask yourself... in what ways might I expand it? Try rewriting it into a tweet-sized provocation.

- What does it remind you of? Try mixing that into the prompt.
- What examples, anecdotes can you include?
- Can you expand on the prompt with a "why" explanation?
