# prompt_generator

A little script that generates prompts to help you write creative prompts.

## How to use it

Close your eyes.  
Take a deep breath.  
Ready?

Run the script.

Now, receive the prompt and ask yourself... in what ways might I expand it? Try rewriting it into a tweet-sized provocation.

- What does it remind you of? Try mixing that into the prompt.
- What examples, anecdotes can you include?
- Can you expand on the prompt with a "why" explanation?
